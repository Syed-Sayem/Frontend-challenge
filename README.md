# React/Next.js Form Challenge

This project is a frontend developer challenge built using React and Next.js. The goal is to create a dynamic user information form with multiple input fields and select boxes with proper validation and state management.

## Features

- A form with an input field and a select box displayed side by side.
- Required field validation with error messages shown below the input and select fields if submitted empty.
- Display of the current form state below the form using <h3> tags.
- A plus (+) button to dynamically add more input and select field pairs.
- Handling onChange events to update and save the form values in the state.
- A delete button beside each select box to remove the corresponding input and select box.
- Validation for all dynamically added fields to ensure no empty values upon submission.
- Display the final form state below the form in a table format for clear visualization.
